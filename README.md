## Problem Title 
AI-Powered Smart Traffic Signal Management System



## Problem Description
An intelligent traffic management system that uses AI/ML algorithms to optimize traffic signal timings in real-time based on vehicle density, traffic flow data, and emergency vehicle detection. The system leverages computer vision and sensor inputs to reduce congestion, prioritize emergency vehicles, and improve overall traffic efficiency, especially in urban areas
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways


## Idea
1. Real-Time Traffic Density Monitoring:
Use live video feeds and/or sensors to analyze traffic density at intersections. AI algorithms process the data to dynamically adjust signal timings and reduce congestion.


2. Emergency Vehicle Detection and Prioritization:
Implement audio and visual recognition to detect sirens and flashing lights of emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, police), automatically adjusting signals to give them the right of way.


3. Interactive Traffic Dashboard:
Provide city officials and traffic operators with a web-based dashboard to monitor real-time traffic conditions, signal patterns, and incident alerts.


4. User Notifications (Optional):
A mobile/web interface that alerts users about optimal routes, signal wait times, and real-time congestion levels.


5. Data Logging and Analytics:
Track and analyze historical data to identify traffic trends, peak hours, and propose long-term infrastructure improvements.
